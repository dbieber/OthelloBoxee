Othello is a native Boxee app made at HackNY Fall 2011.

xmlmaker.py produces the some of xml for main.xml
The reason for this silly structure is that Boxee python has no state,
preventing you from keeping game state and defining reusable functions.
And so we use ui elements to create state. And the logic for each ui element
is specified explicitly. The xmlmaker.py script writes this logic.
